## COVID-19 Mask Binary Class Segmentation using U-Net
In this project, we present a powerful solution for the segmentation of masks in COVID-19-related images using the U-Net architecture. 
Our mission is to contribute to the fight against the pandemic by aiding in the accurate identification of mask-wearing behaviors in images.
The COVID-19 Mask Binary Class Segmentation project focuses on automating the process of detecting masks in images, 
a critical aspect of ensuring safety and compliance with preventive measures. 

This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for implementing the U-Net model, preprocessing data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

Dataset
We've utilized a carefully curated dataset of COVID-19-related images, meticulously annotated with binary mask labels. 
This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the U-Net model's ability to identify mask-wearing instances.

Results
Our U-Net-based solution achieved an impressive Iou metric of 92% on mask binary class segmentation.
