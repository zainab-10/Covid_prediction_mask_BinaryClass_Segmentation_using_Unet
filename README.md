## COVID-19 Mask Binary Class Segmentation using U-Net
In this project, we leverage the robust U-Net architecture to address a crucial challenge: binary mask segmentation in chest X-rays for COVID-19 prediction.
Our objective is to play a significant role in the ongoing battle against the pandemic by enhancing the accuracy of COVID-19 predictions through precise binary mask identification in chest X-ray images.
The essence of our COVID-19 Binary Mask Segmentation initiative lies in automating the detection of masks in chest X-ray images. This automation proves vital in ensuring safety and adherence to preventive measures in the fight against the pandemic.

This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for implementing the U-Net model, preprocessing data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Dataset
We've utilized a carefully curated dataset of COVID-19-related images, meticulously annotated with binary mask labels. 
This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the U-Net model's ability to identify mask-wearing instances.

## Results
Our U-Net-based solution achieved an impressive Iou metric of 92% on mask binary class segmentation.
